* Introduction

** How we messed up...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you
suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself
"Dijkstra would not have liked this", well, that would be enough immortality for
me.

#+END_QUOTE

** Key ideas
+ Dependencies are Graphs!
  #+Begin_SRC shell
    nix-store --query --graph $(readlink -f $(which python)) > python.dot
    dot -Tps python.dot -o python.pdf
  #+END_SRC

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 700
[[./images/closure.png]]

+ Somehow, we'be been failing to represent then as such, or been doing that implicitly.
+ Nix makes it explicit.

** How build packages from source
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    tar -xf source.tar.gz
    cd source
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.mypath
    make
    make install
  #+END_SRC
  + We've been doing this for quite a while, it's almost begging to be automated...

** Nix Ecosystem
| Name    | What it does                                      |
|---------+---------------------------------------------------|
| Nix     | A lazy, untyped, functional programming language. |
| NixOS   | A Linux distribution managed by Nix               |
| Nixpkgs | A place where Nix users place their meta-packages |

The core idea behind ~nix~ is get stuff done in a __reproducible__ way.

** What do we mean by that?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"But we already have Docker..."
#+END_QUOTE

+ Docker (and related container solutions) solve a deployment (sandboxing) problem
+ In a ~Dockerfile~, you have the guarantee your instructions are going run in the same order
  + That doesn't necessary mean you'll get the same results
  + Repeatability doesn't imply reproducibility

* The UNIX hellhole
** The UNIX Hellhole
Package management in most Linux systems is a mess...
+ ~/bin~
+ ~/usr/bin~
+ ~/usr/local/bin~
+ ...

** Nix Store

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1.0\textwidth

** Properties of the ~/nix/store~
+ ~/nix/store/~ is a Graph
+ ~/nix/store/*~ are the *immutable* nodes of that Graph

  #+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.8\textwidth
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    dirname $(readlink -f $(which nvim))
    /nix/store/40vcicw0v28v6bvl18nqa1ldq9v80m27-neovim-0.7.2/bin
  #+END_SRC

** Generations (2)

* Nix Expression Language
** Properties
+ Reproducible
+ Composable

** Characteristics
+ DSL
+ Purelly Functional
+ Dynamically Typed
+ Lazy

** Derivations
+ Derivations are a declarative way to write content in the ~/nix/store/~.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.2\textwidth
#+INCLUDE: "./examples/hello/hello.nix" src nix

** Building our derivation

To build our ~GNU/hello~ derivation we can use the (old) ~nix-build~ command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  nix-build hello.nix
#+END_SRC

then test it:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  ./result/bin/hello
  Hello, world!
#+END_SRC

* Flakes
** Refactoring our Hello app
We can this to refactor our ~hello~ derivation!
** A New CLI
+ ~nix run~
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  nix run nixpkgs#cowsay -- "hello"
#+END_SRC

+ ~nix develop~
** Showing Devenv
It get's better...

* NixOS
** The Linux Distribution

NixOS is a Linux distribution where all packages are built and managed
declaratively by Nix.

+ System rollbacks are a built-in abstraction, simply provided by Nix, when
  combined with a version control system (like Git), then it can be also made
  immutable and [[https://r13y.com/][fully reproducible]].
+ Is both:
  * Source-based & Binary caches
  * Rolling release & not rolling release

** You can also deploy and manage infra with it

** Core Ideas
If one analyzes Eelco's ideas from 2003 and the current DevOps ecosystem, the
following can be noticed:
- [X] Sanboxing is now popular
  * We still we have to convice most of the DevOps world that reproducibility is
    a must. In fact, infrastructure has much to learn from Functional Programming.
- [X] Infra as code is also getting popular
  * But... it's in YAML... or in HCL (sucks less)...
  * Nix is also not the coolest language around, but at least is a real language
- [ ] License compliance is a real thing, mostly ignored by developers
- [ ] Reproducible development environments

Even if Nix never becomes mainstream, it has the right fundamentals.
